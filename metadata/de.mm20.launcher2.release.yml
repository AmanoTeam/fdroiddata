Description: |-
    Kvæsitso is a launcher application for Android
    which replaces the device's default home screen.
    It has been built from scratch, meaning it is not
    based on the AOSP launcher (like many other third
    party launchers) nor does it try to recreate this
    launcher. Instead, Kvæsitso follows its own concepts.

    The main feature is a global search which does not
    only let you search on device for apps, contacts, and
    calendar events, but also on web services like
    Wikipedia or your Nextcloud Instance. Additionally it
    includes some useful tools, for example a calculator
    and a unit converter. You are looking for a document
    or an information? Just search for it and Kvæsitso shows
    you the fastest way to it.

    F-Droid build has the following changes:
    * Disabled OneDrive, GDrive and weather integration;
    * F-Droid version uses a different versionCode.

    Antifeatures:
    * NonFreeNet: app uses a third party service for currency
    exchange rates;
    * UpstreamNonFree: google drive integration depends on
    libraries with non-free dependencies.

MaintainerNotes: |-
    Kvaesitso uses several external APIs for search providers.
    Several of them require signing up to obtain a developer API
    key: gdrive and onedrive search, openweathermap, HERE
    and Meteorologisk institutt. It's not possible for users
    to provide these keys as explained here:
    https://github.com/MM2-0/Kvaesitso/issues/227#issuecomment-1366826219
    Therefore, these features are disabled in F-Droid build.

    Kvaesitso uses a non-whitelisted microsoft maven repo for
    OneDrive integration. The libraries used are open source,
    but we still remove the respective code from the source,
    since onedrive integration is disabled anyway.

    Older patches:
    * remove_ms-services.patch removes microsoft azure sdk maven
    repo and its usage (onedrive integration) across the project.

    * remove_gservices.patch removes gdrive integration, as one
    of dependencies it relies on contains known non-free classes,
    according to f-droid scanner.

    Patches:
    * remove_ms_g_2023012300.patch removes microsoft and google
    services from the source code, while patching of respective
    modules build.gradle.kts files is done with sed edits, since
    these files are changed often.

    Upstream provides an fdroid flavor, however there's no difference
    and it still needs to be patched.
