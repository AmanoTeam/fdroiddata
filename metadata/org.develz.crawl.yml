Summary: A roguelike adventure through dungeons in a quest to find the Orb of Zot
Description: |-
    Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup is a roguelike game of exploration
    and treasure-hunting in dungeons filled with dangerous and
    unfriendly monsters in a quest for the mystifyingly fabulous
    Orb of Zot.

    Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup has diverse species and many different
    character backgrounds to choose from, deep tactical game-play,
    sophisticated magic, religion and skill systems, and a grand
    variety of monsters to fight and run from, making each game
    unique and challenging.

    Android controls:
    * The back key works as an alias for escape.
    * Two finger scrolling works on menus.
    * Volume keys zoom the dungeon and the map.
    * There's an extra icon in the commands menu to toggle the virtual keyboard.
